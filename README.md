# Description
This is a collection of scripts and accompanying example datasets that are intended to be used internally for commonly used bioinformatic pipelines including: antismash, bigscape, genome assembly, local blast, and differential abundance analysis. To use these tools, simply click on the folder and follow the installation and usage instructions in the corresponding README.md file. A folder titled "example_data" is included with each pipeline serving as a test case and example for proper script function.
